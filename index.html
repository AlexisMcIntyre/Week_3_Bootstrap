<!--Section 1-Top of Page w Banner-->

<!--I styled my page headers with "display" to make them stand out from the text below. I also placed and image below within a span class for formatting and a border, then made the image class fluid so that it would be responsive to the screen size.-->
<div class="container text-center p-2" >
    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <h1 class="display-1">DMTB!</h1>
        <h3 class="display-3">(Don't Miss These Books!)</h3>

            src="book_shelf.JPG"
            class="container-fluid"
            alt="Books on a shelf"
         />
        </span>

<!--Section 2-Book Selection-->

<!--Below I experimented with formatting within a fluid container. It is made up of 3 elements which are the text box, the 3 link columns, and the newsletter or form box. The text box took the fluid formatting from its parent class of being fluid. The link boxes and form box also took the fluid property from their parent, but I broke out some rows and columns. The 3 link boxes are each in their own column, and assigned them the size of 3 with the form being a size of 9 so they aligned. I gave them a break point of small so that they wouln't start stacking until the screen size was smaller than 576px. In the form, I did a mock newsletter signup where I have the user entering their email with th email input type and had a selection class so they could pick which free book they want from several options. Finally I had a checkbox as an option if they also want to sign up for a different newsletter. -->
